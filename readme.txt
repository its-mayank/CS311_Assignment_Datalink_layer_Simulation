This program is the implementataion of data link layer and physical layer .

It contains of four files datalink ,physical client and server

Datalink contains implementation of CRC Error detection ,framing.

Physical layer consists of manchester encoding and decoding

Client and server is used as a medium and implemented through socket programming.

Input to the program is any message then it is converted into bits and then headers are addaed then framing is done and crc is implemented then the whole data is manchester encoded This all happens in DATALINK LAYER

Inphysical layer ALL the process are reversed(decoded) and message is checked.
